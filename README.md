Lung cancer remains a prominent cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the critical importance of early detection and precise diagnosis for effective treatment. Histopathological analysis of lung tissue is a standard diagnostic approach. however, its manual interpretation is prone to errors and time-intensive. In this study, we explore the potential of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to streamline the classification of lung cancer types, including benign tissue, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, based on histopathological images. Our Hybrid  CNN model demonstrates notable performance, achieving a training accuracy of 99.3\% and testing accuracy of 96.9\%. These findings underscore the promise of CNNs in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer diagnosis, thereby facilitating prompt treatment decisions and potentially improving patient outcomes.
